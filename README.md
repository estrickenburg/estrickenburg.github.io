# Planning Site for Professional Development Class

## Beth Strickenburg

**Week 1**

What did you do last week?
- I researched different approaches and resources for learning both Java and Kubernetes, watching some videos on both LinkedIn Learning and Youtube, as well as looking through some books.
- I created the website for this class
  
What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to settle on a direction for my project and write the project proposal.
- I plan to start more structured learning in either Java or Kubernetes
  
Are there any impediments in your way?
- Mostly just my own indecision. I start a new job on Monday, and I wish I had a better idea of what skill would be most useful for me to focus on this semester.
  
Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- Next week I want to be more organized and decisive in my time management.
- I should have a better sense for what will be a helpful skill to complement what I'm learning at work.
