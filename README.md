- I'm eager to settle into a rhythm with learning Java so that I can use my time effectively

**September 19th**

What did you do last week?
- Started learning Java. The LinkedIn Learning course has been easy to follow and provides a nice combination of video instruction, coding exercises, and quizzes. I’ve been able to move pretty quickly for the first part of the course since it starts with the basics, but I’m sure my pace will slow when I get into harder topics. 

What do you plan to do this week?
- Continue learning Java. 
- Always follow along with the coding exercises in IntelliJ as I watch.
- When I have questions or am curious about how something works, stop the video and play around with it. 

Are there any impediments in your way?
- One of the issues I ran into this past week is keyboard shortcuts. At home I have a macbook and at work I have a linux machine. I realized that the keyboard shortcuts for IntelliJ are very different on the two machines (and not just like the difference of swapping out the Ctrl and Command key). Part of what I want to improve on is my ability to use keyboard shortcuts for Java programming in IntelliJ, so I need to figure out a solution for this. 

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I’m considering bringing home my work laptop in order to practice with its keyboard shortcuts. I also want to look up more about whether it’s feasible to change the keyboard shortcuts on one or the other of the IntelliJ instances so that they match. 

**September 26th**

What did you do last week?
- Continued with Java learning and practice. Got further into conditionals, looping, and different kinds of expressions. Took my time and played around with new syntax as it came up.
- I also spent some of my learning time brushing up on docker and docker compose. I'm thinking that I might incorporate this as a secondary learning goal in my project. It's another concept that's coming up a lot at work, and that I'd like to learning in a deeper way.
- Made some updates to my project website

What do you plan to do this week?
- Continue learning Java. 
- Try things out on my own in IntelliJ (in addition to the LinkedIn Learning exercises)
- Add in some learning about containerization, especially docker, kubernetes, and helm. 

Are there any impediments in your way?
- The main impediment is knowing how to balance my time, especially as I add in a secondary learning goal for my project.

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I think I should dedicate specific time to studying containerization that is separate from my Java studies. As I progress farther, I hope to find a mini project that combines the two areas of study.

**October 3rd**

What did you do last week?
- I continued with Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure and am almost finished with this course (which is the first portion of the "Learning Path"). The first few units went really quickly, but my pace is a bit slower now that the material is covering more things that are brand new for me. Completing the exercises as I go has been invaluable. I haven't had to rely on hints or look ahead and solutions yet, and it's forced me to slow down and apply the new concepts I'm learning.

What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to finish the Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure course and get a good start on the Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs course.

Are there any impediments in your way?
- None

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I want to continue to do all of the exercises as I go without looking ahead at the solutions. This will be more time intensive as the material gets more complex, but I'm finding that it's time well spent.

**October 10th**

What did you do last week?
- I completed Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure (focusing in on Arrays and String methods) and I began the the Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs course. The code challenges are getting a bit more challenging, so I’m finding myself spending more time on them. It’s been an excellent way to cement my understanding.
  
What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to continue the Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs course, completing the coding exercises as I go.
  
Are there any impediments in your way?
- The coding interface in LinkedIn Learning is slightly buggy at times and keeps freezing up so that I can’t type. It doesn’t happen too often, but when it does it’s quite frustrating.
  
Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I may switch to just replicating the coding challenges in IntelliJ to avoid the bugginess.

**October 17th**

What did you do last week?
- I completed the activity on accessing lifelong learning resources by watching a LinkedIn Learning course on difficult conversations. This was a helpful exercise and fit in well with my work context, as I'm coming up on the end of the year review season.
- I also continued with the Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs course, which has been super interesting. I focused in on inheritance between classes this week, and I practiced several skills that had come up in some of my most recent tickets at work. The coding challenges are taking more time, but I'm finding them to be directly applicable to my work environment, which has been really fun and encouraging.
  
What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to continue the Java course, focusing on Polymorphism and Abstraction.
  
Are there any impediments in your way?
- None
  
Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- This week re-emphasized to me the importance of taking my time with the coding exercises. I was watching the videos and everything seemed very straight forward, but when I went to do the coding exercises I realized that I didn't understand the concepts as well as I'd thought I did. It's so interesting to me how coding concepts require such a deeper understanding to implement than to just explain. As I move forward, I want to continue to take my time with the exercises and make sure I can implement the concepts rather than just having a surface understanding. 

**October 24th**

What did you do last week?
- I continued working through the LinkedIn Learning course Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs, focusing on Polymorphism and Abstraction. I'm continuing to learn new concepts and skills through this course, and I'm finding the coding exercises to be both interesting and useful. I'm also incorporating more note-taking around the coding exercises (not just the lectures) into my process.
- I continue to be able to apply the concepts and skills that I'm through in this course in the tickets I'm completing at work, which has been really exciting!

What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to continue through the Java course, focusing on Interfaces and Data Structures.

Are there any impediments in your way?
- None

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- One of the things that I plan to do this week is to give myself a larger chunk of time over the weekend to work on my project. I've been splitting up the work in small chunks over the course of the week, and while that works ok, I think it would be useful to have a larger time period to focus in more deeply on the learning.
- I've also found it useful to take thorough notes, not only while watching the lectures but also just after completing the coding exercises. The exercises are where the concepts really solidify for me, so taking notes about what I learned specifically through the exercises has been a good practice.

**October 31st**

What did you do last week?
- This week I focused on Interfaces, Sets, and Lists in the Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs course. Interfaces in particular were a new concept for me, so it took a bit to get the hang of it. The coding exercises have continued to be useful. I'm also finding myself spending more time looking through the Java docs when I come across new concepts in the LinkedIn Learning course. The videos are a good introduction, and they help me get a sense for where I should focus as I read the documentation. The documentation is super helpful, and has so much more detail than the videos. 

What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to continue through the Java course, doing the coding exercises as I go, and spending time in the Java documentation when I come across interesting new concepts.

Are there any impediments in your way?
- During my current sprint at work I've transitioned to doing more work with Kubernetes and Helmfiles, and less with Java. It's not an impediment really, but it was fun and motivating to be able to use the Java concepts I was learning about so readily at work. I'll just need to keep up my motivation. 

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- Spending more time in the Java documentation has been a great addition from this past week, and I plan to continue with this moving forward in the course.

**November 7th**

What did you do last week?
- This week my Java studies focused on data structures and functional programming. I'm getting into some really interesting new concepts, especially around functional programming. I knew that there was some interoperability and cross-over between Java and Scala, but the unit on functional interfaces in Java blew my mind. A lot the syntax felt like it was straight out of Scala and our Principles of Programming Languages class! I think that spending time really understanding this side of Java will serve me well, especially since my company has a lot of legacy code written in Scala, but we're transitioning into using Java instead. The interoperability between the two languages means that I'm ending up needing to extend out Scala functions and use them in Java. 
- I also found the section on Stream operations in Java to be fascinating. It's such a different approach from object oriented programming that's it's taking me a bit to wrap my head around it. But it seems very powerful.

What do you plan to do this week?
- This week I plan to continue with the LinkedIn Learning Java studies, as well as spending time in the Java documentation when I run across interesting new concepts. 

Are there any impediments in your way?
- I'll be out of town this coming weekend, so I'll need to be very intentional about my time.

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I've continued to find it very useful to spend time in the documentation alongside the LinkedIn Learning class. I want to continue to do this as well as completing all of the coding exercises.

**November 14th**

What did you do last week?
- I focused on exception handling in Java this week. The LinkedIn Learning course provided a good starting point and went into some really interesting concepts like try-with-resources (which allows you to name the resources you'll be using and the resources automatically get closed down if an exception is thrown), and using polymorphism to catch multiple exceptions. When I ran across things that I didn't fully understand from the videos, I looked them up in the Java docs, which was then very helpful in completing the coding exercises.
- I finished the Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs LinkedIn Learning course 

What do you plan to do this week?
- Since I completed the Objects and APIs course, I get to pick a new one to start this week. I've decided not to go in order with the "Learning Path," since I know I won't be able to finish all of the courses this semester. Instead, I'll pick the ones that are most interesting to me. With this in mind, I think I'm going to dive into the Java Collections course this week.

Are there any impediments in your way?
- None

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- Being able to sit down for larger chunks of time this week was helpful for my concentration in learning and absorbing the material. I'm going to try to continue that this coming week.
  
**November 21st**

What did you do last week?
- This week I dove into the Java Collections course on the LinkedIn Learning Path, and it's proving to be a great choice. The lecturer for this course is more engaging than the lecturers for the last few courses, and he presents the material in a fun and interesting way.
- I've worked with Collections before, but the lectures I watched this week helped me gain a clearer understanding of how interfaces and extensions work within the framework. I particularly appreciated a lecture that compared code implementations of a class using an ArrayList (from the Java Collections framework) with the same class implemented as a regular old array. The comparison and contrast helped me understand some of the advantages and shortcuts that are provided by using the Collections framework.

What do you plan to do this week?
- This week (or rather, the week after Thanksgiving break), I plan to continue with Java Collections course. This course has been particularly fun and interesting so far, so I think it will be easy to motivate myself. Generics, iterators, and lambdas are coming up, so should be lots of fun concepts.

Are there any impediments in your way?
- None

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- My learning time was more enjoyable this week because the lecturer was better. I'll keep this in mind as I pick and choose the courses from the Learning Path during the rest of the semester. 

**December 5th**

What did you do last week?
- I continued working through the course on Java Collections, which has been really interesting. The coding challenges have been helpful as well.
- I decided that I wanted a bit more practical application practice for Java, so I also did some Leetcode problems in Java. This proved to be a great way to get some additional practice with the concepts that wasn't specifically tailored to go along with the course material.

What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to continue (and hopefully finish!) the Java Collections course as well as writing up my final project report.

Are there any impediments in your way?
- This coming week is quite busy for me at work, so I'll need to stay disciplined with my time.

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I found the addition of Leetcode practice for Java to be quite useful and I'd like to continue with that this week as well.

## Project Proposal

*Vision Statement*

For my project this semester, I plan to learn Java. This will contribute directly to my professional development because the company where I work uses Java extensively. I’ve worked in several different programming languages, but I currently have no experience with Java. Learning Java will expand my applicable skills at work and allow me to dive into new projects more quickly. 

*Motivation*

This project is important to me because I know that the learning curve at my new job will be steep for me and I’ve been wishing that I already knew Java. I’m passionate about taking the time outside of work to increase my skills and be prepared for projects that might come up that use Java.

*Learning Objectives*

I plan to use the LinkedIn Learning path “Getting Started as a Java Developer,” which includes the following courses:

- Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure
- Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs
- Learning Spring with Spring Boot
- Learning JDBC
- Learning Java Collections
- Java Memory Management: Values and References
- Java Memory Management: Garbage Collection, JVM Tuning, and Spotting Memory Leaks
- Java Exception Handling
- Java Algorithms
- Java Data Structures

This learning path is listed as 19 hours and 15 minutes of content, and learners earn a certificate of completion at the end. 

I also hope to either modify the exercises in the tutorials or branch off and do a mini project of my own at some point during the semester. In this way, I should be able to gain even more insight into Java development than I could get by simply coding along with the exercises.

*Risks to Project Completion and Mitigation of Risks*

The main risk to completion I see is if the exercises take longer than I expect them to. As I was researching how much time coding LinkedIn Learning courses take when you do all of the exercises included in the course, most people recommended allotting 2-3 times the listed content time in order to complete all of the exercises. I plan to complete the exercises as I go, so if it takes me a bit over 2 times the listed content time, it should work perfectly with the 45 hour time allotted to this project over the semester. If it takes me significantly longer than this (which is possible, since I have no previous experience with Java), then the timing would not work out. 

The main mitigation I see for this risk is to keep my goal somewhat flexible and adjust it if needed. If it becomes necessary, I can adjust the goal of how much of this learning path I complete over the course of the semester. This would be fairly easy to do, as the learning path is already divided into a series of courses. I could just choose to complete fewer of the courses. This would mean that I wouldn’t achieve the completion certificate by the end of the semester, but I could always complete the rest at a later time.

*Project Assessments*

One of the advantages of using a resource like a LinkedIn Learning path is that there are easy ways to measure progress. I can measure how many of the videos I’ve watched, how I’ve scored on the quizzes, and whether my solutions to the exercises work effectively. I think I will also find it easier to stay on track since the material is already organized in this way. Successful completion of the project would be to make it through all of the content in the learning path while completing the exercises and mini-projects and then to receive the certification at the end. 

## Final Report

*Introduction*

For my project in this class, I chose to learn the Java programming language. At the beginning of the semester, I had just accepted a new full-time position as a backend software engineer and knew that I would be working a lot in Java. This course provided an excellent opportunity for me to learn and study the language outside of work, while also developing skills that would be vital to my professional life. I envisioned this project as an organized journey into the syntax and structures of Java development, where I would make use of structured learning materials while also giving myself time to practice and use the language. 

*Background*

A main motivation for me in choosing this project was its applicability to my work. In my previous internship experience, I had worked in Python, Swift, and React, but my new role required a lot of Java development work, and I quickly realized that I needed a deeper understanding of Java. As I started working on my initial tickets, I found myself having to Google basic structures of the language and wishing that I had more time to devote to it. This project provided an excellent way to dig deeper into this study and it served as an important complement to the things that I was learning on the job.

My background before computer science was in foreign languages (I have an M.A. in French literature) and I’ve realized that I thoroughly enjoy learning new programming languages as well. There are similarities in how one goes about learning both spoken languages and coding languages – gaining a new vocabulary, utilizing new syntax, practicing new ways of expressing the same idea in many contexts. As I enter the work world in computer science, I want to continue to make use of my language learning skills, and this project provided an excellent avenue for that as well.


*Methodology, Materials, and Methods*

In terms of materials and learning methods, I knew that I wanted to have something structured and organized as the backbone of my learning. I chose to follow LinkedIn Learning’s “Getting Started as a Java Developer” path. This learning path includes a number of different courses about Java development, and initially I was thinking that I could go through all of the courses over the course of the semester. It quickly became clear to me that this wasn’t an achievable goal, because the estimated time for the courses (listed in the learning path) is just equal to the time it takes to watch the lectures. I knew that taking the time to do all of the coding exercises was an important step in my learning, so I slowed down my pace in order to do this. Spending time with the coding exercises so that I could truly understand and apply the concepts was incredibly valuable for me. 
In light of this transition of scope, I chose to complete three courses on the learning path: “Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure,” “Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs,” and “Learning Java Collections.” In addition to watching the lectures and completing the coding exercises, I found a few other resources along the way that were helpful to incorporate into my learning. 

The first additional resource I found was reading and studying Java documentation. When I ran across tricky concepts or things that I didn’t fully understand from the LinkedIn Learning lectures, I looked them up in the Java documentation and spent time understanding them in further depth. This not only gave me a fuller understanding of the concept, it also helped me grow my skills in navigating and utilizing documentation. The second resource I incorporated was completing Leetcode problems in Java. This gave me more practical problem solving experience in Java that wasn’t specifically linked to course material. These two elements proved to be both helpful and complementary to the LinkedIn Learning courses. 

*Results*

Throughout the semester, I gained a tremendous amount in terms of both my knowledge of Java as a language and my ability to apply it in practical settings. The concepts that I found to be the most interesting were inheritance, polymorphism, and the details of the Java Collections framework. All three of the concepts were things I was able to apply directly to tickets I was working on for my job as well. I created several classes that relied heavily on inheritance and polymorphism, and having a stronger understanding of the Collections framework helped me to structure my code in a way that felt more native to the Java syntax.

The LinkedIn Learning courses were a good guide and a helpful way to stay “on track” with what I was learning each week. But I also found that  it was even more important to take time to apply and practice the concepts rather than to just grind through more lectures in order to make it through the courses more quickly.  Taking time to do the coding exercises on my own, looking up specifics in the Java docs as I was learning new concepts, and practicing Java through Leetcode problems ended up being as or more important than the lectures in terms of my overall learning.

The assessments I set for myself were baked into the LinkedIn Learning courses and included the number of courses completed, the accuracy of coding solutions, and the quizzes. I could tell through my coding solutions and quiz responses that I was learning the material well, but I also realized quickly that I would not make it through nearly as much of the material as I had planned in order to learn the concepts thoroughly. The coding problems took more time than I had anticipated, but it also felt like incredibly valuable time spent. I remembered the concepts so much more after completing coding problems than I would have if I’d just watched the lectures. So it seemed like an obvious choice to slow my pace and take the time I needed to truly understand and apply the concepts rather than rushing through the lectures. 

*Discussion/Reflection*

Looking back over the semester, I can see huge leaps forward in terms of my knowledge of and skills in Java programming. From my time diving into Java documentation description of polymorphism to completing coding exercises based in the Java Collections framework, I’ve deepened my understanding of the language in significant ways. Being able to apply what I learned this semester so readily at work made the project feel especially worthwhile, and I know that I will continue to use and expand my knowledge moving forward.

As I reflect on things that could have gone better, I wish that I had thought of using Leetcode earlier in the semester. Weaving in this sort of practical coding proved to be incredibly useful and it could have aided my learning earlier on in the semester. It was also a helpful way to reinforce what I was learning in a way that was tied to the curriculum. 

I wish I had gotten even farther in the LinkedIn Learning path, but I feel like I’m leaving this project with a solid footing and good knowledge of where to look for further resources. I have plenty more solid LinkedIn learning courses, and I have both Java documentation and Leetcode problems at my fingertips.

*Conclusion*

Learning Java was a great project for me this semester. It was straightforward and organized because I used the LinkedIn Learning courses as the backbone of my learning. But I also felt like I could spend the time I needed to on the practical application of coding exercises and Leetcode. Being able to apply the concepts so readily at work helped keep me very motivated, and I’m excited to keep strengthening my Java knowledge and skills beyond this project as well.
