**September 19th**

What did you do last week?
- Started learning Java. The LinkedIn Learning course has been easy to follow and provides a nice combination of video instruction, coding exercises, and quizzes. I’ve been able to move pretty quickly for the first part of the course since it starts with the basics, but I’m sure my pace will slow when I get into harder topics. 

What do you plan to do this week?
- Continue learning Java. 
- Always follow along with the coding exercises in IntelliJ as I watch.
- When I have questions or am curious about how something works, stop the video and play around with it. 

Are there any impediments in your way?
- One of the issues I ran into this past week is keyboard shortcuts. At home I have a macbook and at work I have a linux machine. I realized that the keyboard shortcuts for IntelliJ are very different on the two machines (and not just like the difference of swapping out the Ctrl and Command key). Part of what I want to improve on is my ability to use keyboard shortcuts for Java programming in IntelliJ, so I need to figure out a solution for this. 

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I’m considering bringing home my work laptop in order to practice with its keyboard shortcuts. I also want to look up more about whether it’s feasible to change the keyboard shortcuts on one or the other of the IntelliJ instances so that they match. 

**September 26th**

What did you do last week?
- Continued with Java learning and practice. Got further into conditionals, looping, and different kinds of expressions. Took my time and played around with new syntax as it came up.
- I also spent some of my learning time brushing up on docker and docker compose. I'm thinking that I might incorporate this as a secondary learning goal in my project. It's another concept that's coming up a lot at work, and that I'd like to learning in a deeper way.
- Made some updates to my project website

What do you plan to do this week?
- Continue learning Java. 
- Try things out on my own in IntelliJ (in addition to the LinkedIn Learning exercises)
- Add in some learning about containerization, especially docker, kubernetes, and helm. 

Are there any impediments in your way?
- The main impediment is knowing how to balance my time, especially as I add in a secondary learning goal for my project.

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I think I should dedicate specific time to studying containerization that is separate from my Java studies. As I progress farther, I hope to find a mini project that combines the two areas of study.

**October 3rd**

What did you do last week?
- I continued with Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure and am almost finished with this course (which is the first portion of the "Learning Path"). The first few units went really quickly, but my pace is a bit slower now that the material is covering more things that are brand new for me. Completing the exercises as I go has been invaluable. I haven't had to rely on hints or look ahead and solutions yet, and it's forced me to slow down and apply the new concepts I'm learning.

What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to finish the Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure course and get a good start on the Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs course.

Are there any impediments in your way?
- None

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I want to continue to do all of the exercises as I go without looking ahead at the solutions. This will be more time intensive as the material gets more complex, but I'm finding that it's time well spent.

**October 10th**

What did you do last week?
- I completed Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure (focusing in on Arrays and String methods) and I began the the Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs course. The code challenges are getting a bit more challenging, so I’m finding myself spending more time on them. It’s been an excellent way to cement my understanding.
  
What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to continue the Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs course, completing the coding exercises as I go.
  
Are there any impediments in your way?
- The coding interface in LinkedIn Learning is slightly buggy at times and keeps freezing up so that I can’t type. It doesn’t happen too often, but when it does it’s quite frustrating.
  
Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I may switch to just replicating the coding challenges in IntelliJ to avoid the bugginess.

**October 17th**

What did you do last week?
- I completed the activity on accessing lifelong learning resources by watching a LinkedIn Learning course on difficult conversations. This was a helpful exercise and fit in well with my work context, as I'm coming up on the end of the year review season.
- I also continued with the Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs course, which has been super interesting. I focused in on inheritance between classes this week, and I practiced several skills that had come up in some of my most recent tickets at work. The coding challenges are taking more time, but I'm finding them to be directly applicable to my work environment, which has been really fun and encouraging.
  
What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to continue the Java course, focusing on Polymorphism and Abstraction.
  
Are there any impediments in your way?
- None
  
Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- This week re-emphasized to me the importance of taking my time with the coding exercises. I was watching the videos and everything seemed very straight forward, but when I went to do the coding exercises I realized that I didn't understand the concepts as well as I'd thought I did. It's so interesting to me how coding concepts require such a deeper understanding to implement than to just explain. As I move forward, I want to continue to take my time with the exercises and make sure I can implement the concepts rather than just having a surface understanding. 

**October 24th**

What did you do last week?
- I continued working through the LinkedIn Learning course Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs, focusing on Polymorphism and Abstraction. I'm continuing to learn new concepts and skills through this course, and I'm finding the coding exercises to be both interesting and useful. I'm also incorporating more note-taking around the coding exercises (not just the lectures) into my process.
- I continue to be able to apply the concepts and skills that I'm through in this course in the tickets I'm completing at work, which has been really exciting!

What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to continue through the Java course, focusing on Interfaces and Data Structures.

Are there any impediments in your way?
- None

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- One of the things that I plan to do this week is to give myself a larger chunk of time over the weekend to work on my project. I've been splitting up the work in small chunks over the course of the week, and while that works ok, I think it would be useful to have a larger time period to focus in more deeply on the learning.
- I've also found it useful to take thorough notes, not only while watching the lectures but also just after completing the coding exercises. The exercises are where the concepts really solidify for me, so taking notes about what I learned specifically through the exercises has been a good practice.

**October 31st**

What did you do last week?
- This week I focused on Interfaces, Sets, and Lists in the Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs course. Interfaces in particular were a new concept for me, so it took a bit to get the hang of it. The coding exercises have continued to be useful. I'm also finding myself spending more time looking through the Java docs when I come across new concepts in the LinkedIn Learning course. The videos are a good introduction, and they help me get a sense for where I should focus as I read the documentation. The documentation is super helpful, and has so much more detail than the videos. 

What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to continue through the Java course, doing the coding exercises as I go, and spending time in the Java documentation when I come across interesting new concepts.

Are there any impediments in your way?
- During my current sprint at work I've transitioned to doing more work with Kubernetes and Helmfiles, and less with Java. It's not an impediment really, but it was fun and motivating to be able to use the Java concepts I was learning about so readily at work. I'll just need to keep up my motivation. 

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- Spending more time in the Java documentation has been a great addition from this past week, and I plan to continue with this moving forward in the course.

**November 7th**

What did you do last week?
- This week my Java studies focused on data structures and functional programming. I'm getting into some really interesting new concepts, especially around functional programming. I knew that there was some interoperability and cross-over between Java and Scala, but the unit on functional interfaces in Java blew my mind. A lot the syntax felt like it was straight out of Scala and our Principles of Programming Languages class! I think that spending time really understanding this side of Java will serve me well, especially since my company has a lot of legacy code written in Scala, but we're transitioning into using Java instead. The interoperability between the two languages means that I'm ending up needing to extend out Scala functions and use them in Java. 
- I also found the section on Stream operations in Java to be fascinating. It's such a different approach from object oriented programming that's it's taking me a bit to wrap my head around it. But it seems very powerful.

What do you plan to do this week?
- This week I plan to continue with the LinkedIn Learning Java studies, as well as spending time in the Java documentation when I run across interesting new concepts. 

Are there any impediments in your way?
- I'll be out of town this coming weekend, so I'll need to be very intentional about my time.

Reflecting on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I've continued to find it very useful to spend time in the documentation alongside the LinkedIn Learning class. I want to continue to do this as well as completing all of the coding exercises. 
  
## Project Proposal

*Vision Statement*

For my project this semester, I plan to learn Java. This will contribute directly to my professional development because the company where I work uses Java extensively. I’ve worked in several different programming languages, but I currently have no experience with Java. Learning Java will expand my applicable skills at work and allow me to dive into new projects more quickly. 

*Motivation*

This project is important to me because I know that the learning curve at my new job will be steep for me and I’ve been wishing that I already knew Java. I’m passionate about taking the time outside of work to increase my skills and be prepared for projects that might come up that use Java.

*Learning Objectives*

I plan to use the LinkedIn Learning path “Getting Started as a Java Developer,” which includes the following courses:

- Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure
- Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs
- Learning Spring with Spring Boot
- Learning JDBC
- Learning Java Collections
- Java Memory Management: Values and References
- Java Memory Management: Garbage Collection, JVM Tuning, and Spotting Memory Leaks
- Java Exception Handling
- Java Algorithms
- Java Data Structures

This learning path is listed as 19 hours and 15 minutes of content, and learners earn a certificate of completion at the end. 

I also hope to either modify the exercises in the tutorials or branch off and do a mini project of my own at some point during the semester. In this way, I should be able to gain even more insight into Java development than I could get by simply coding along with the exercises.

*Risks to Project Completion and Mitigation of Risks*

The main risk to completion I see is if the exercises take longer than I expect them to. As I was researching how much time coding LinkedIn Learning courses take when you do all of the exercises included in the course, most people recommended allotting 2-3 times the listed content time in order to complete all of the exercises. I plan to complete the exercises as I go, so if it takes me a bit over 2 times the listed content time, it should work perfectly with the 45 hour time allotted to this project over the semester. If it takes me significantly longer than this (which is possible, since I have no previous experience with Java), then the timing would not work out. 

The main mitigation I see for this risk is to keep my goal somewhat flexible and adjust it if needed. If it becomes necessary, I can adjust the goal of how much of this learning path I complete over the course of the semester. This would be fairly easy to do, as the learning path is already divided into a series of courses. I could just choose to complete fewer of the courses. This would mean that I wouldn’t achieve the completion certificate by the end of the semester, but I could always complete the rest at a later time.

*Project Assessments*

One of the advantages of using a resource like a LinkedIn Learning path is that there are easy ways to measure progress. I can measure how many of the videos I’ve watched, how I’ve scored on the quizzes, and whether my solutions to the exercises work effectively. I think I will also find it easier to stay on track since the material is already organized in this way. Successful completion of the project would be to make it through all of the content in the learning path while completing the exercises and mini-projects and then to receive the certification at the end.
