# Planning Site for Professional Development Class

## Beth Strickenburg

## Weekly Updates

**Week 1**

What did you do last week?
- I researched different approaches and resources for learning both Java and Kubernetes, watching some videos on both LinkedIn Learning and Youtube, as well as looking through some books.
- I created the website for this class
  
What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to settle on a direction for my project and write the project proposal.
- I plan to start more structured learning in either Java or Kubernetes
  
Are there any impediments in your way?
- Mostly just my own indecision. I start a new job on Monday, and I wish I had a better idea of what skill would be most useful for me to focus on this semester.
  
Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- Next week I want to be more organized and decisive in my time management.
- I should have a better sense for what will be a helpful skill to complement what I'm learning at work.

**Week 2**

What did you do last week?
- Wrote project proposal and posted a draft to Piazza
- Commented on 3 classmate proposals
- Updated my project proposal based on classmate feedback
- Downloaded IntelliJ onto my laptop and took the IntelliJ tutorial
  
What do you plan to do this week?
- Begin the LinkedIn Learning course Java Essential Training, completing the exercises as I go.
  
Are there any impediments in your way?
- None
  
Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I was able to confirm with my team at work that Java development learning should be a high priority for me, confirming my choice for this project
- I'm eager to settle into a rhythm with learning Java so that I can use my time effectively

## Project Proposal

*Vision Statement*

For my project this semester, I plan to learn Java. This will contribute directly to my professional development because the company where I work uses Java extensively. I’ve worked in several different programming languages, but I currently have no experience with Java. Learning Java will expand my applicable skills at work and allow me to dive into new projects more quickly. 

*Motivation*

This project is important to me because I know that the learning curve at my new job will be steep for me and I’ve been wishing that I already knew Java. I’m passionate about taking the time outside of work to increase my skills and be prepared for projects that might come up that use Java.

*Learning Objectives*

I plan to use the LinkedIn Learning path “Getting Started as a Java Developer,” which includes the following courses:

- Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure
- Java Essential Training: Objects and APIs
- Learning Spring with Spring Boot
- Learning JDBC
- Learning Java Collections
- Java Memory Management: Values and References
- Java Memory Management: Garbage Collection, JVM Tuning, and Spotting Memory Leaks
- Java Exception Handling
- Java Algorithms
- Java Data Structures

This learning path is listed as 19 hours and 15 minutes of content, and learners earn a certificate of completion at the end. 

I also hope to either modify the exercises in the tutorials or branch off and do a mini project of my own at some point during the semester. In this way, I should be able to gain even more insight into Java development than I could get by simply coding along with the exercises.

*Risks to Project Completion and Mitigation of Risks*

The main risk to completion I see is if the exercises take longer than I expect them to. As I was researching how much time coding LinkedIn Learning courses take when you do all of the exercises included in the course, most people recommended allotting 2-3 times the listed content time in order to complete all of the exercises. I plan to complete the exercises as I go, so if it takes me a bit over 2 times the listed content time, it should work perfectly with the 45 hour time allotted to this project over the semester. If it takes me significantly longer than this (which is possible, since I have no previous experience with Java), then the timing would not work out. 

The main mitigation I see for this risk is to keep my goal somewhat flexible and adjust it if needed. If it becomes necessary, I can adjust the goal of how much of this learning path I complete over the course of the semester. This would be fairly easy to do, as the learning path is already divided into a series of courses. I could just choose to complete fewer of the courses. This would mean that I wouldn’t achieve the completion certificate by the end of the semester, but I could always complete the rest at a later time.

*Project Assessments*

One of the advantages of using a resource like a LinkedIn Learning path is that there are easy ways to measure progress. I can measure how many of the videos I’ve watched, how I’ve scored on the quizzes, and whether my solutions to the exercises work effectively. I think I will also find it easier to stay on track since the material is already organized in this way. Successful completion of the project would be to make it through all of the content in the learning path while completing the exercises and mini-projects and then to receive the certification at the end.
